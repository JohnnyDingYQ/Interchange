# Description and Motivation
Interchange is a indie game in which you build highways and interchanges! This game was inspired by Cities: Skylines and Mini Motorways. I love building highways in Cities: Skylines, but I am less intrigued by the city planning and simulation aspect of the game. The economy system of Cities: Skylines 2 is broken and bugged anyway (as of March 6, 2024). As a result, I decided to make an indie game that does one thing and one thing well: building highways! The game will generate incrementing traffic demand (similar to Mini Motorways), and the players' job is to build highways to satisfy the increasing demand. Players will build on the terrain of famous locations such as NYC and Shanghai. It will be possible to open Google Maps along with the game and emulate the real world highway network. In my opinion, this is why the game idea is exciting.
